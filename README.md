# midori
Midori is a WIP real-time chess server.

Deployed at [shahmat.org](https://shahmat.org/)

The current goal for this project is to match the feature set of [dojo](https://github.com/macroby/dojo), a previous "demo" chess server that I had built.

 At the moment, "Anon vs Computer" is the only feature implemented with only one level of difficulty.

[gchess](https://github.com/macroby/gchess) provides chess logic.

[gchessboard](https://github.com/macroby/gchessboard) is a javascript chessboard component built with gleam and lustre.

The bot moves are generated by [fairy-stockfish](https://fairy-stockfish.github.io/).
